<h1>MT.MACULOT</h1>
<p>Mt. Maculot is one of the most well-known hiking spots in the Philippines. This mountain stands at 930 meters above sea level. The hike to the summit is rated 4/9 in difficulty level. Even though some parts of the mountain trail are slippery, steep, and muddy, a reasonably physically fit person can do the trek.</p> 
<p>Mt. Maculot is situated in Barangay Cuenca, Batangas. Before trekking, you will need to pay a fee and register with the local authorities. You also need to hire a trained guide to ensure a safe journey.</p> 
<p>The climb has three main destinations, which are “the Grotto,” “the Rockies,” and “The Summit.” “The Grotto” is the site for the Lady of Lourdes shrine and a popular vantage point for Mt. Maculot’s summit. “The Summit” offers views of the Taal Volcano Island, the Labangan Bay, and Mount Makiling, a dormant volcano. “The Rockies” is the third vantage point that has views of the picturesque rocky cliffs along the southernmost part of Lake Taal.</p>
