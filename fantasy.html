<h1>FANTASY WORLD</h1>
<p>Fantasy World was meant to be the Philippine version of Disneyland. Itâ€™s supposed to be the largest and grandest theme park in the country. However, this ambitious project has remained unfinished. Fantasy World has never opened as a theme park. According to local stories and rumors, the Japanese owner had financial problems and, therefore, stopped the construction years ago. </p> 
<p>Despite being a failed project, Fantasy World is still a favorite Batangas tourist spot and a frequent filming location. Its large fairytale castle, medieval-themed structures, and sad story have managed to attract many tourists. </p> 
<p>While here, you can walk around, enter the fairytale-like buildings and take photos. One popular spot in the abandoned park is the hanging bridge connected to two treehouses. You can climb to the top of the treehouses and enjoy the views of Batangas, including the Taal Volcano. </p>
