<h1>MONTE MARIA SHRINE</h1>
<p>Monte Maria is not just a shrine but an international pilgrimage and conference center built in honor of the Virgin Mary. Formally known as Montemaria International Pilgrimage and Conference Center, the complex spans 8 hectares and is situated 20 kilometers outside of Batangas City.</p> 
<p>Monte Maria is one of the top Batangas tourist spots because of its uniqueness. It is meant to be both a religious and tourism site. Although devotees and pilgrims are attracted to it, Monte Maria caters to regular tourists as well. </p> 
<p>The main landmark of the center is the Virgin Mary Shrine, officially named Mother of All Asia-Tower of Peace. At over 98 meters, this tower is considered one of the tallest Virgin Mary statues in the world. It sits on the top of a plateau, about 148 meters above sea level. The tower overlooks Verde Island Passage, Batangas Bay, and parts of Oriental Mindoro.</p>
<p>Monte Maria houses two chapels, a restaurant, a souvenir shop, and impressive architectural designs. It is also a retreat and retirement center that has rooms and spaces for workshops and conferences. Monte Maria is about 20 kilometers away from Batangas City.</p>
