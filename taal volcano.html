<h1>TAAL VOLCANO</h1>
<p>Taal Volcano is the most recognizable landmark of Batangas. Standing at only 3 meters above sea level, it is one of the smallest volcanoes in the world. Aside from its size, Taal stands out because of its unique physical features.</p> 
<p>Inside the Taal Volcanoâ€™s caldera lies the beautiful Taal Lake, which surrounds more than 40 craters and cones. In the middle of this lake sits Volcano Island. At the center of Volcano Island is another lake referred to as the Main Crater Lake.</p> 
<p>The main tourist activity around Taal used to be trekking to the main crater on foot or a horse. Due to safety reasons, the local government currently prohibits Taal Volcano trekking tours. However, you can still enjoy Taal Volcano panoramas from vantage points in the lakeshore towns of Talisay and San Nicolas or when you book Tagaytay hotels. These towns have many restaurants, cafes, and small resorts that offer great food and amazing views of Taal Volcano.</p>
