<h1>FORTUNE ISLAND</h1>
<p>The islandâ€™s history is quite interesting as it used to be the site of a luxurious resort. Unfortunately, the resort closed down because of the huge maintenance cost and the absence of freshwater sources. The Grecian Acropolis, which sits on top of a limestone cliff, is a reminder of Fortune Island's luxury resort days.</p> 
<p>The jumping point to Fortune Island is the Fortune Island Resort on the mainland. You must pay an entrance fee at the resort to enter the island. You will also need to ride a boat for 1 to 1.5 hours to reach the island. </p> 
<p>Aside from swimming and relaxing on the beach, some activities you can do while on Fortune island include trekking the island, visiting the lighthouse, and snorkeling. Remember to bring your own equipment to snorkel.   </p>
